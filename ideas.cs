----1---

The idea of doing things differently!

this one is about the collision and the mesh deformation.

i'll put a script on every collider first.

onCannonBall script, i'll make whatever it touches, add a rigidbody to it.
set it to usegravity false, this way its going to move.

and i'll try to match that with the collider.

-then i'll delete it -


----2---
make thousands of little colliders for every 10 vertex or so.
and use our implemented technique to move them around. lets see if we can do that.
this looks promising but i can't say the same about the performance. lolz.
whatever lets go.
